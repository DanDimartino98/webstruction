# Email Setup for Webstruction Contact Form

## Current Implementation

The contact form now uses a reliable email approach:

1. **Primary**: Resend (recommended for production)
2. **Fallback**: Server-side logging (for debugging and manual processing)

## Issue Resolution

**Problem**: FormSubmit.co was unreliable and not delivering emails consistently.

**Solution**: Implemented server-side logging as a fallback to ensure form submissions are captured even when email services fail.

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended)

1. Sign up at [Resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   ```
4. Deploy to Vercel and add the environment variable in your Vercel dashboard

### Option 2: FormSubmit.co (Current Fallback)

The form will automatically fall back to FormSubmit.co if Resend is not configured.

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Being Received

1. **Check Spam Folder**: Emails might be going to spam
2. **Verify Email Address**: Ensure `hughesdaniel98@gmail.com` is correct
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages in the browser console
4. **Test API Route**: Try submitting a test form and check server logs

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: The new API route eliminates CORS issues
2. **Network Errors**: Server-side handling provides better error reporting
3. **FormSubmit Limitations**: Direct client-side calls to FormSubmit can fail due to referrer policies

## Testing

To test the form:

1. Fill out the form at `/getstarted`
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Check server logs for submission attempts
4. Verify email delivery in your inbox

## Logging

The API route includes comprehensive logging:
- Form submission attempts
- Email service responses
- Error details for debugging

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

For Vercel deployment, add the environment variable in your Vercel dashboard.
